  ################################ SUMMARY ################################

  st.title("Airbnb NY listings Data Analysis")
  st.markdown('-----------------------------------------------------')

  st.markdown("*Through Airbnb NY data we will conduct an exploratory analysis and offer insights into that data. For this we will use the data behind the website **Inside Airbnb** come from publicly available information on the Airbnb website available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/), containing advertisements for accommodation in NY until 2020*")


  st.header("Summary")

  st.markdown("Airbnb is a platform that provides and guides the opportunity to link two groups - the hosts and the guests. Anyone with an open room or free space can provide services on Airbnb to the global community. It is a good way to provide extra income with minimal effort. It is an easy way to advertise space, because the platform has traffic and a global user base to support it. Airbnb offers hosts an easy way to monetize space that would be wasted.")

  st.markdown("On the other hand, we have guests with very specific needs - some may be looking for affordable accommodation close to the city's attractions, while others are a luxury apartment by the sea. They can be groups, families or local and foreign individuals. After each visit, guests have the opportunity to rate and stay with their comments. We will try to find out what contributes to the listing's popularity and predict whether the listing has the potential to become one of the 100 most reviewed accommodations based on its attributes.")

  st.markdown('-----------------------------------------------------')

  st.header("Airbnb New York Listings: Data Analysis")
  st.markdown("Following is presented the first 10 records of Airbnb data. These records are grouped along 16 columns with a variety of informations as host name, price, room type, minimum of nights,reviews and reviews per month.")
  st.markdown("We will start with familiarizing ourselves with the columns in the dataset, to understand what each feature represents. This is important, because a poor understanding of the features could cause us to make mistakes in the data analysis and the modeling process. We will also try to reduce number of columns that either contained elsewhere or do not carry information that can be used to answer our questions.")

  st.dataframe(df.head(10))

  st.markdown("Another point about our data is that it allows sorting the dataframe upon clicking any column header, it a more flexible way to order data to visualize it.")

  #################### DISTRIBUIÇÃO GEOGRÁFICA ######################

  st.header("Listing Locations")
  st.markdown("Airbnb’s first New York listing was in Harlem in the year 2008, and the growth since has been exponential. Below we highlight the geographical distribution of listings. Initially we can filter them by price range, minimum number of available nights and number of reviews, so more flexibility is added when looking for a place. ")
  st.markdown("We could also filter by listing **price**, **minimum nights** on a listing or minimum of **reviews** received. ")

  values = st.slider("Price Range ($)", float(df.price.min()), float(df.price.clip(upper=10000.).max()), (500., 1500.))

  st.markdown("In a general way the map shows that locations in the city centre are more expensive, while the outskirts are cheaper (a pattern that probably does not only exists in New York). In addition, the city centre seems to have its own pattern.")
  st.markdown("Unsurprisingly, Manhattan island has the highest concentration of expensive Airbnbs. Some are scattered over Brooklyn too. The heftiest price tag is $10.000,00. Another likely insight is that if we know that a specific location is very close to a place we consider expensive most probably the whole sorrounding area will be expensive.")
  st.markdown("Highly rated locations also tend to be the most expensive ones. Again downtown Manhattan and adjacent areas of Brooklyn receive the highest location scores, with East Village being an exception. A marked drop in location scores is seen as the subway lines end.")
  st.markdown("In a side analysis it can be possible to see that around Manhattan there are much fewer flats than compared to areas around, in addition, most of the points of interest (_Empire State Buildind, Times Square, Central Park_) are located in ‘expensive’ areas, especially around Dam Square's district.")
  st.markdown("In Staten Island, the areas close to the State Park have the highest location scores. Brooklyn neighbourhoods close to Manhattan tend to have higher location ratings. Looking at the NY subway system in Brooklyn, it is interesting to observe that the highly rated areas correspond with subway line presence. The same is true for Bronx where subway lines do not go.")

  #################### AREAS OF INTEREST ######################

The boroughs of Queens and Bronx are concurrent with the counties of the same name, while the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island correspond to those of New York, Kings and Richmond, respectively.")

  st.markdown("**How do prices of listings vary by location? What localities in NYC are rated highly by guests?** Manhattan has the most expensive rentals compared to the other boroughs. Prices are higher for rentals closer to city hotspots. Rentals that are rated highly on the location by the host also have higher prices")

  st.markdown("**How does the demand for Airbnb rentals fluctuate across the year and over years?** In general, the demand (assuming that it can be inferred from the number of reviews) for Airbnb listings has been steadily increasing over the years.")

  st.markdown("**Are the demand and prices of the rentals correlated?** Average prices of the rentals increase across the year, which correlates with demand.")

  st.header("Limitations")

  st.markdown(" - We did not have data for past years and hence could not compare current rental trends with past trends. Hence, there was an assumption made, particularly in the demand and supply section of the report to understand the booking trends.")
